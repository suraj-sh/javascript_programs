5.  Explain the differences between using a for loop, a for...of loop, and the forEach 
    method to loop through arrays.  

->  1. For Loop:
        - Traditional loop structure with `for` keyword.
        - Provides fine-grained control over iteration.
        - Requires manual indexing and bounds checking.
        - Suitable for more complex looping scenarios.

    2. For...of Loop:
        - Modern loop introduced in ES6.
        - Iterates over values directly without the need for indexing.
        - Easier and cleaner syntax for simple array iteration.
        - Doesn't provide index or access to the original array.

    3. forEach Method:
        - Array method designed for simple iteration.
        - Automatically iterates over each element in the array.
        - Cleaner and more concise for basic looping needs.
        - Provides a callback function for each iteration, but doesn't return a new array.
