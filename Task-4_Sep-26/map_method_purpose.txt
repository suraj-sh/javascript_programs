8.  Explain the purpose of the map method for arrays and how it differs from other array methods.

->  The purpose of the `map` method for arrays in JavaScript is to create a new array by 
    applying a function to each element of the original array. It differs from other array 
    methods in that it doesn't modify the original array but instead returns a new array with 
    the results of the applied function. This makes it useful for transforming or mapping values 
    from one array to another, maintaining immutability and data integrity.
