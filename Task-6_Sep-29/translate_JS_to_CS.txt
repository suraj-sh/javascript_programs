13. Translate the following JavaScript loop into CoffeeScript: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); }

->  CoffeeScript code for the JavaScript loop:

        for i in [0..4]
        console.log(i)

    In CoffeeScript:

    - `for i in [0..4]` is used to create a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive).

    - `console.log(i)` is used to print the value of `i` in each iteration.
