16. Describe a scenario where socket communication could be advantageous in a web application.

->  Scenario:   In a collaborative online whiteboard application, 
                socket communication is advantageous. 
                When one user draws or adds an element on the whiteboard, 
                the changes need to be instantly reflected on the screens of all 
                other users in the same session. Sockets enable real-time updates, 
                allowing all users to see the drawing as it happens, creating a seamless 
                and collaborative experience.
