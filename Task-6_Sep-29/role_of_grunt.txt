2.  Explain the role of Grunt in web development and its purpose in tasks like CSS minification.
    Write the configuration code necessary to set up Grunt for CSS minification in a project.

->  Role of Grunt in Web Development:
    Grunt is a task runner in web development that automates repetitive tasks, such as minifying CSS, 
    JavaScript, optimizing images, and more. It helps streamline development workflows, 
    enhance project organization, and improve code quality by automating time-consuming tasks.

    Purpose of Grunt in CSS Minification:
    One of the purposes of Grunt is to automate CSS minification. Minifying CSS involves removing 
    unnecessary white spaces, comments, and optimizing the code to reduce its size. 
    This results in faster page load times and improved website performance.

    Here's the configuration code to set up Grunt for CSS minification in a project:

    1. Project Setup and Dependencies:
        - Create a project directory if you haven't already.
        - Initialize a `package.json` file using `npm init`.
        - Install Grunt and the necessary Grunt plugin for CSS minification:

        npm install grunt grunt-contrib-cssmin --save-dev
    
    2. Create a Gruntfile:
        - In your project directory, create a `Gruntfile.js`. This file will define your Grunt 
          configuration and tasks.

    3. Configure Grunt CSS Minification:
        - Inside your `Gruntfile.js`, configure the Grunt `cssmin` task to specify which CSS files 
          to minify and where to save the minified output:

        module.exports = function(grunt) {
            grunt.initConfig({
            cssmin: {
                target: {
                files: {
                    'dist/style.min.css': ['src/*.css']
                }
                }
            }
            });

            grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-cssmin');

            grunt.registerTask('default', ['cssmin']);
        };
    
    In this example, we've configured Grunt to minify all CSS files in the `src` directory and 
    save the minified output as `style.min.css` in the `dist` directory.

    4. Run the Grunt Task:
        - Open your terminal and run the `grunt` command to execute the default task:

        grunt
    
    Grunt will now minify the specified CSS files, and the minified output will be available in 
    the `dist` directory.

    This setup automates the process of CSS minification using Grunt in your web development project, 
    helping improve website performance by reducing the size of your CSS files.
