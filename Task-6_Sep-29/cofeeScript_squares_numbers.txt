Practical Task 2:   Create a CoffeeScript loop that prints out the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

->  To create a CoffeeScript loop that prints out the squares of numbers from 1 to 10, 
    you can use a for loop. 
    
    Here's an example:

        # Loop from 1 to 10 and print the squares
        for i in [1..10]
        square = i * i
        console.log "The square of #{i} is #{square}"
        
    In this CoffeeScript code:

    We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 10, inclusive. [1..10] represents the range from 1 to 10.

    Inside the loop, we calculate the square of the current number i using i * i.

    We use console.log to print the result, including the original number and its square.
