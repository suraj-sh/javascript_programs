11. Write a simple CoffeeScript function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

->  CoffeeScript function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum:

    add = (num1, num2) ->
    return num1 + num2

    # Example usage:
    result = add(5, 3)
    console.log(result)  # Output: 8

    In this CoffeeScript code:

    - We define a function called `add` that takes `num1` and `num2` as parameters.

    - Inside the function, we use the `+` operator to add the two numbers together.

    - We return the result of the addition.

    - Finally, we demonstrate how to use the `add` function by calling it with `add(5, 3)` 
      and logging the result to the console.
