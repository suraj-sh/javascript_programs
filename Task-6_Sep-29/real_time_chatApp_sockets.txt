Practical Task 3:   Imagine you're building a real-time chat application using sockets. 
                    How would you structure the project and implement socket communication between users?

->  To structure a real-time chat application using sockets, you can follow these steps:

    1. Project Setup:
        - Set up the project directory and install necessary dependencies 
        (e.g., Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io).

    2. Server Setup:
        - Create a Node.js server using Express.js.
        - Initialize Socket.io to handle WebSocket communication.

    3. Client Setup:
        - Build a client-side interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        - Include Socket.io client library in your HTML file.

    4. User Authentication:
        - Implement user authentication and session management for secure communication.

    5. Socket Communication:
        - Set up Socket.io to handle real-time communication between users.
        - Listen for events like "connect," "disconnect," and custom events for chat messages.
        - When a user sends a message, emit the message event to the server.
        - The server receives the message and broadcasts it to the appropriate recipient(s).

    6. Message Storage:
        - Optionally, store chat messages in a database for persistence.

    7. Display Messages:
        - Update the chat interface to display incoming and outgoing messages in real-time.

    8. Additional Features:
        - Implement additional features like user presence (online/offline status), typing indicators, 
        and message history.

    9. Deployment:
        - Deploy your server-side code to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or a VPS).
        - Deploy your client-side code to a web server or use a static hosting service.

    10. Testing and Scaling:
        - Test the chat application for reliability and scalability.
        - Consider load balancing and clustering for handling a larger number of users.

    This structure provides a basic outline for building a real-time chat application using sockets. 
    Keep in mind that the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements and 
    the technologies you choose to use.
