18. Write JavaScript code to establish a socket connection and emit a "message" 
    event with a specific message payload.

->  To establish a socket connection and emit a "message" event with a specific message payload in JavaScript, 
    you can use the Socket.io library, which simplifies WebSocket communication. 
    Here's an example of how to do it:

    First, make sure you have Socket.io installed in your project. You can install it via npm:

        npm install socket.io-client
    
    Next, you can use the following code on the client-side to establish a socket connection and emit 
    a "message" event:

        // Import the Socket.io client library
        const io = require('socket.io-client');

        // Replace 'http://localhost:3000' with your server's URL
        const socket = io.connect('http://localhost:3000');

        // Emit a "message" event with a specific payload
        const messagePayload = {
        username: 'John',
        text: 'Hello, world!',
        };

        socket.emit('message', messagePayload);

        // Listen for server responses or other events (if needed)
        socket.on('response', (data) => {
        console.log('Server responded:', data);
        });

        // Handle disconnect events (if needed)
        socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('Disconnected from the server.');
        });
        

    In this code:

    1. You import the Socket.io client library.

    2. You establish a socket connection to the server by providing the server's URL 
        (replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with your server's actual URL).

    3. You emit a "message" event with a specific payload (`messagePayload` in this case).

    4. You can also listen for server responses or other events using `socket.on()`.

    5. You handle the disconnect event if needed.

    Remember to replace the server URL with the actual URL of your server. 
    On the server-side, you would need to set up a corresponding listener for the "message" 
    event to handle the incoming message and respond accordingly.
