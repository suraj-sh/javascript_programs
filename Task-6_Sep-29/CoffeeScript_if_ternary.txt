12. Provide examples of using if statements and the ternary operator in CoffeeScript.

->  Examples of using if statements and the ternary operator in CoffeeScript:

    Using if Statements:
    
        # If statement
        if x > 10
        console.log("x is greater than 10")
        else
        console.log("x is not greater than 10")

        # If-else if-else statement
        if temperature > 30
        console.log("It's hot outside!")
        else if temperature > 20
        console.log("It's warm outside.")
        else
        console.log("It's cold outside.")

        # Unless statement (opposite of if)
        unless isRaining
        console.log("It's not raining, go outside!")

        # Single-line if
        console.log("Good weather") if isSunny
    

    Using the Ternary Operator:
    
        # Ternary operator for conditional assignment
        result = if x > 0 then "Positive" else "Negative"

        # Ternary operator for conditionally executing code
        isWeekend = true
        message = "Enjoy the weekend!" if isWeekend else "It's a weekday."

        # Ternary operator for concise boolean assignment
        isLoggedIn = true
        canAccessResource = isLoggedIn ? true : false
    

    In the examples above:

    - We use `if` statements to perform conditional checks and execute code blocks based on the conditions.

    - The `unless` statement is the opposite of `if`, and it executes the code block when the condition is false.

    - Single-line `if` statements allow for concise conditional execution of code.

    - The ternary operator (`?`) is used for conditional assignment, concise conditional code execution, 
      and boolean assignment based on conditions. It's a shorthand way to express `if-else` conditions.
