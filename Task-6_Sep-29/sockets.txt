15. What are sockets in the context of web development, and why are they used?

->  Sockets in web development are a communication technology that allows real-time, 
    two-way communication between a web browser (client) and a web server. 
    They are used to enable instant data exchange without the need for the client to 
    repeatedly request information from the server.

    Here's why sockets are used:

    1. Real-Time Interaction: Sockets enable real-time interactions, such as chat applications, 
                              online gaming, or collaborative tools, where updates are immediately sent 
                              and received, creating a more interactive user experience.

    2. Efficiency: Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are one-way (client to server), 
                   sockets enable bidirectional communication, reducing the overhead of repeatedly 
                   polling the server for updates.

    3. Push Notifications: Sockets are used to send push notifications to clients, allowing servers to 
                           inform clients about events or changes without the client having to request updates.

    4. Live Updates: They power live updates in web applications, like stock market tickers, live sports scores, 
                     or social media feeds, ensuring users see the latest information as it happens.

    In summary, sockets in web development provide a mechanism for real-time, efficient, 
    and interactive communication between clients and servers, enabling a wide range of dynamic 
    and engaging web applications.
