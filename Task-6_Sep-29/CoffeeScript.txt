10. What is CoffeeScript, and why might developers choose to use it over traditional JavaScript?

->  CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles into JavaScript. Developers might choose to 
    use it over traditional JavaScript because:

    1. Simplicity: CoffeeScript offers a more concise and readable syntax, reducing the need for 
                   punctuation and boilerplate code, making code easier to write and maintain.

    2. Cleaner Code: It generates cleaner, more human-readable JavaScript, which can enhance code 
                     quality and reduce the chance of errors.

    3. Familiarity: Developers from languages like Python or Ruby may find CoffeeScript's syntax 
                    more familiar and comfortable.

    4. Readability: CoffeeScript emphasizes code readability, helping teams collaborate more 
                    effectively and understand codebases quickly.

    5. Compatibility: CoffeeScript code compiles to standard JavaScript, ensuring compatibility 
                      with all JavaScript libraries and platforms.
