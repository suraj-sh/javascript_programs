1.3 List some advantages of using a separate JavaScript file instead of embedding scripts directly 
    into HTML documents.

->  Advantages of using a separate JavaScript file instead of embedding scripts directly into 
    HTML documents:

    1. Modularity: Separation allows for cleaner code organization and easier maintenance.

    2. Caching: JavaScript files can be cached by browsers, improving page load times for 
                returning users.

    3. Reusability: You can reuse the same JavaScript file across multiple HTML pages.

    4. Readability: HTML remains clean and focused on content, while JavaScript is in its dedicated file.

    5. Collaboration: Easier collaboration between front-end and back-end developers, 
                      as they can work on their respective code separately.

    6. Debugging: Debugging tools in browsers work more effectively with external JavaScript files.

    7. Minification: External files can be minified for faster downloads, improving website performance.
