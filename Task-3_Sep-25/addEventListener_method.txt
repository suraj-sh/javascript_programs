3.1 Describe the role of the addEventListener method in the DOM and how it enables interactivity.

->  The `addEventListener` method in the DOM allows you to specify a function (an event handler) 
    to be executed when a specific event occurs on an HTML element. It enables interactivity 
    by letting you respond to user actions like clicks, keypresses, or mouse movements. 
    When the specified event happens, the associated function is triggered, 
    allowing you to perform actions like updating content, validating user input, 
    or triggering animations, making your web pages interactive and responsive to user interactions.
