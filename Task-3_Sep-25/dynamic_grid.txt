4.1 Explain the concept of a dynamic grid on a web page and why it can be useful 
    for creating responsive layouts.

->  A dynamic grid on a web page is a layout structure that adjusts and reorganizes its 
    content based on screen size and content changes. It's useful for creating responsive 
    layouts because it ensures that content is displayed optimally on various devices and screen sizes, 
    such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Dynamic grids help maintain a consistent and 
    user-friendly design, improving the user experience by adapting to different viewing contexts.
