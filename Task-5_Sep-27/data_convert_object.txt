5.  Write a function in JavaScript that uses AJAX to retrieve data from a Google Sheet and 
    convert the response text into a JavaScript object.

->  To retrieve data from a Google Sheet using AJAX and convert the response text into a JavaScript object, 
    you can use the `fetch` API, which is a modern way to make HTTP requests. Additionally, 
    Google Sheets provides an API endpoint for retrieving data in JSON format.

    Here's a JavaScript function that demonstrates how to do this:

        function fetchDataFromGoogleSheet() {
        // Replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL' with the URL of your Google Sheet (Make sure it's published to the web)
        const sheetURL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL';

        // Use the fetch API to send a GET request to the Google Sheets URL
        fetch(sheetURL)
            .then((response) => {
            // Check if the response status is OK (200)
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
            }
            // Parse the response as JSON and return it
            return response.json();
            })
            .then((data) => {
            // 'data' now contains the Google Sheet data as a JavaScript object
            console.log(data);
            
            // You can process and work with the data here
            })
            .catch((error) => {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
            });
        }

        // Call the function to retrieve data from the Google Sheet
        fetchDataFromGoogleSheet();


        Replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_URL'` with the URL of your Google Sheet (make sure it's published to the web). 
        This code will send a GET request to the Google Sheets URL, and when the data is received, 
        it will be parsed as JSON and made available as a JavaScript object in the `data` variable. 
        You can then process and work with the data as needed in the `.then` block.

    Make sure to handle errors appropriately, as shown in the code, to provide better error handling 
    in your application.
