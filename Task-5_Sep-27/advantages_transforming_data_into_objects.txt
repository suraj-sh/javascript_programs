7.  How can Google Sheet data be transformed into a JavaScript object, and what advantages does 
    this offer in terms of data manipulation?

->  Google Sheet data can be transformed into a JavaScript object by parsing the data received 
    from Google Sheets API into a JavaScript object using functions like `JSON.parse()`. 
    This transformation offers advantages in terms of data manipulation because:

    1. Structured Data: JavaScript objects provide a structured way to organize data, 
                        making it easier to access and manipulate specific values.

    2. Simplified Access: Data in JavaScript objects can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation, 
                          simplifying data retrieval and modification.

    3. Flexibility: JavaScript objects can be easily modified, filtered, sorted, and transformed to 
                    suit specific needs, making data manipulation more straightforward.

    4. Integration: JavaScript objects seamlessly integrate with JavaScript libraries and frameworks, 
                    enhancing compatibility and functionality in web development.

    Overall, converting Google Sheet data into a JavaScript object streamlines data manipulation and 
    enhances flexibility when working with the data in web applications.
