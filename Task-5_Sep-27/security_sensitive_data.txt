4.  How can you ensure the security of sensitive data when fetching and displaying information 
    from a Google Sheet on a public-facing webpage?

->  To ensure the security of sensitive data when fetching and displaying information from a Google Sheet 
    on a public-facing webpage:

    1. Use Permissions: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the Google Sheet data by 
                            setting appropriate sharing permissions within Google Sheets.

    2. Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization on your webpage to control 
                           who can access the data.

    3. HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between your webpage and the Google Sheet to
                  prevent eavesdropping.

    4. Data Minimization: Only fetch and display the data you need, and avoid exposing unnecessary 
                              sensitive information.

    5. Server-Side Processing: Consider fetching and processing sensitive data on a secure server 
                                   rather than directly on the client-side.

    6. Data Masking: If necessary, mask sensitive data (e.g., by replacing it with placeholders) 
                         to protect user privacy.

    7. Regular Updates: Keep your software and libraries up-to-date to address security 
                            vulnerabilities.

    8. Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and testing to identify and mitigate 
                            potential risks.

    9. Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) 
                       when handling sensitive user data.

    By implementing these measures, you can enhance the security of sensitive data when displaying it 
    from a Google Sheet on a public-facing webpage.
