1.2 Explain the process of creating your first JavaScript program.

->  Creating your first JavaScript program involves these basic steps:

    1. Set Up: Open a text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or a code editor of your choice.

    2. Write HTML: Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and add a `<script>` tag inside 
                   the `<body>` or `<head>` section to link to your JavaScript file.

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>My First JavaScript Program</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <script src="myscript.js"></script>
        </body>
        </html>

    3. Create JavaScript File: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., myscript.js) in the same directory 
                               as your HTML file.

    4. Write JavaScript Code: Inside your JavaScript file, write your JavaScript code.

        // myscript.js
        alert("Hello, World!");

    5. Run the Program: Open your HTML file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking 
                        it or right-clicking and selecting "Open with..." your preferred browser.

    6. View Output: You will see an alert dialog with the message "Hello, World!" displayed 
                    in your web browser.
