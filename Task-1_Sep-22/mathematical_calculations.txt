3.2 Describe how mathematical calculations are performed in JavaScript.

->  Mathematical calculations in JavaScript are performed using mathematical operators like 
    `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulo for remainder). 
    
    You can use these operators between numbers to perform calculations like:

        var result = 5 + 3; // Addition: result will be 8
        var difference = 10 - 7; // Subtraction: difference will be 3
        var product = 4 * 6; // Multiplication: product will be 24
        var quotient = 20 / 5; // Division: quotient will be 4
        var remainder = 17 % 4; // Modulo (remainder): remainder will be 1


    These operators allow you to perform various mathematical operations and are essential for 
    numerical computations in JavaScript.
