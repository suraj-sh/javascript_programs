2.3 Describe how to assign names to your variables.

->  To assign names to your variables:

    1. Choose a Descriptive Name: Pick a name that reflects the purpose or content of the variable. 
                                  Use meaningful words.

    2. Follow Naming Rules: Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. 
                            They must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.

    3. Avoid Reserved Words: Don't use reserved words (e.g., "if," "function") as variable names.

    Examples of valid variable names:
    - `userName`
    - `totalAmount`
    - `_privateVar`

    Examples of invalid variable names:
    - `123abc` (starts with a digit)
    - `if` (uses a reserved word)
    - `my-variable` (contains a hyphen, which is not allowed)
