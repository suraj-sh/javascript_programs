1.8 Explain the purpose of the JavaScript console.

->  The JavaScript console is a tool used for debugging and testing JavaScript code in a web browser. 
    It allows developers to:

    1. View Output: See the output of their code, like log messages and errors.

    2. Inspect Variables: Check the values of variables during program execution.

    3. Debug Errors: Identify and fix code errors or issues.

    4. Interact with the Page: Execute JavaScript commands directly in the browser for testing.

    The console is a valuable tool for developers to ensure their JavaScript code runs smoothly and 
    to diagnose and resolve issues effectively.
