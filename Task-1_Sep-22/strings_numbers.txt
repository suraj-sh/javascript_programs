2.4 Introduce the concepts of strings and numbers in JavaScript.

->  In JavaScript:

    1. Strings: Strings are sequences of characters (like text) enclosed in 
                single (' ') or double (" ") quotes. 
                Example: `"Hello, World!"`.

    2. Numbers: Numbers represent numeric values, either integers (whole numbers) 
                or decimals (floating-point numbers). 
                Example: `42` or `3.14`.

    You can use strings for text and numbers for mathematical operations or calculations 
    in your JavaScript programs.
