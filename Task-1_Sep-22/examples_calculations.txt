3.3 Walk through examples of working with numbers and calculations.

->  Examples of working with numbers and calculations in JavaScript:

    1. Basic Arithmetic:
    
        var a = 5;
        var b = 3;

        var sum = a + b; // Addition: sum is 8
        var difference = a - b; // Subtraction: difference is 2
        var product = a * b; // Multiplication: product is 15
        var quotient = a / b; // Division: quotient is 1.6667
    

    2. Increment and Decrement:
   
        var count = 10;
        count++; // Increment: count is now 11
        count--; // Decrement: count is back to 10
    

    3. Modulo (Remainder):

        var remainder = 17 % 4; // Modulo (remainder): remainder is 1
    

    4. Math Object:

    JavaScript provides a `Math` object with various methods for more complex calculations:

        var radius = 5;
        var area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2); // Calculate the area of a circle
    

    These examples demonstrate common numeric operations and calculations you can perform in JavaScript.
