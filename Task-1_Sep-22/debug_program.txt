1.9 Take a JavaScript program with a bug and debug it using the console.

        alert("Let's Begin The Challenge!");

        document.write("Congrats You Fixed This Line Of Code!";


        Console.lo("Good Job Your Almost There!");

        Console.log("If this appears in the console then you have completed the challenge, Well Done!")


->  Corrected JavaScript code with debugging using the console:

        alert("Let's Begin The Challenge!");

        document.write("Congrats You Fixed This Line Of Code!");

        console.log("Good Job You're Almost There!");

        console.log("If this appears in the console, then you have completed the challenge. Well Done!");


    1. Added a missing closing parenthesis for the `document.write` statement.
    2. Corrected capitalization for `console.log` to make it `console.log` for both lines.
    3. Fixed grammar in the second `console.log` message.

    Now, the code should work as expected and display messages in the console without any errors.
