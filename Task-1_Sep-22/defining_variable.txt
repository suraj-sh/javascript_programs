2.2 Define a variable and explain its role in programming.

->  A variable is a named storage location in programming used to hold and manage data. 
    Its role is to store and represent information such as numbers, text, or objects 
    so that you can manipulate, retrieve, and use that data in your program. 
    Variables make it possible to work with dynamic and changing data, allowing programs 
    to perform calculations, make decisions, and respond to user input effectively.

    Example of a variable in JavaScript:

        var age = 23;

    In this example:

    - `var` is the keyword used to declare a variable.
    - `age` is the variable name.
    - `30` is the data stored in the variable.

    You can now use the `age` variable to perform various operations or display it in your program. 
    For instance:

        console.log("I am " + age + " years old.");

    This code would output: "I am 30 years old."
