2.6 Explain the process of combining strings together in JavaScript.

->  In JavaScript, you can combine (concatenate) strings together using the `+` operator. 
    Here's a simple process:

    1. Create Strings: Have the strings you want to combine ready.

        var firstName = "Suraj";
        var lastName = "Sharma";


    2. Combine Strings: Use the `+` operator to join them together.

        var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

    Now, `fullName` contains the combined string: "Suraj Sharma".
