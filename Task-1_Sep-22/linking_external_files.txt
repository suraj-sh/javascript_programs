1.7 Describe the process of linking an external JavaScript file from an HTML document.

->  To link an external JavaScript file from an HTML document:

    1. Create the JavaScript File: First, create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) 
                                   with your JavaScript code.

    2. Include the `<script>` Tag: Inside your HTML document, within the `<head>` or at the end of 
                              the `<body>` section, add the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute 
                              pointing to your JavaScript file.

        <script src="script.js"></script>

    3. Save Both Files: Ensure both the HTML and JavaScript files are saved in the same directory 
                        or provide the correct file path in the `src` attribute if they are in different 
                        directories.

    4. Load the HTML Document: Open your HTML document in a web browser. The external JavaScript file 
                               will be automatically loaded and executed.

    This process allows you to separate your HTML and JavaScript code, making your code more organized 
    and maintainable.
