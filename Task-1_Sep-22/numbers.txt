3.1 Define numbers in the context of JavaScript.

->  In the context of JavaScript, "numbers" refer to numeric data types used to represent 
    both whole numbers (integers) and numbers with decimal points (floating-point numbers). 
    Numbers in JavaScript are used for mathematical calculations, comparisons, and various 
    numeric operations within programs. 
    
    Here are examples of JavaScript numbers:

    - Integer: `42`
    - Floating-point: `3.14`

    JavaScript provides a range of functions and operators for working with numbers, 
    making it a versatile language for mathematical operations and numeric data manipulation.
