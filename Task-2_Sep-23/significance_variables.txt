1.8 Describe the significance of variables and data types in programming.

->  Variables and data types are essential in programming because they enable you to:

    1. Store Information: Variables let you store and manage data, such as numbers, text, 
                          or values, which your program can use and manipulate.

    2. Manipulate Data: Different data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans) allow you 
                        to perform various operations, calculations, and transformations in your code.

    3. Control Flow: Variables help control program flow by storing values that influence decisions 
                     and actions through conditional statements and loops.

    4. Reuse Code: Variables make your code more modular and reusable, as you can store values 
                   in variables and reference them throughout your program.

    Overall, variables and data types are the building blocks of programming, enabling you to 
    work with and process information effectively.
