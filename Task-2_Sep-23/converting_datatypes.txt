2.5 How can you convert between different data types in JavaScript?

->  You can convert between different data types in JavaScript using methods like:

    1. String Conversion: Use `String()` or `toString()` functions to convert to a string.

    2. Number Conversion: Use `Number()` or `parseInt()`/`parseFloat()` functions to convert 
                          to a number.

    3. Boolean Conversion: Use `Boolean()` to convert to a boolean.

    4. Implicit Conversion: JavaScript may perform automatic type conversion in some situations, 
                            like when using operators (+, ==) or functions that expect specific types.

    Explicitly applying these conversion methods helps ensure data is in the desired format for your code.
