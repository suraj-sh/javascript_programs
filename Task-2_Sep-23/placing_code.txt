1.7 Where can you place your JavaScript code for execution?

->  We can place our JavaScript code for execution in three main locations: 

    1. Inline: Directly within an HTML file using the `<script>` tag.
    2. Internal: Inside the `<script>` tag within the HTML document's `<head>` 
                 or `<body>` section.
    3. External: In a separate .js file linked to the HTML document using the 
                 `<script>` tag's `src` attribute.

    These locations determine when and how our JavaScript code runs on a web page.
