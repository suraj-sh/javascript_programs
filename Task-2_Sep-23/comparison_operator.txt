3.4 Describe comparison operators and their role in conditional statements.

->  Comparison operators in JavaScript are used to compare values and determine 
    the truth or falsity of a condition. They play a crucial role in conditional 
    statements like `if`, `else if`, and `while`.

    Common comparison operators include:
        - `==` (equal to)
        - `!=` (not equal to)
        - `<` (less than)
        - `>` (greater than)
        - `<=` (less than or equal to)
        - `>=` (greater than or equal to)

    For example:
    
        var age = 20;

        if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
        } 
        else {
            console.log("You are a minor.");
        }


    In this code, the `>=` comparison operator is used in an `if` statement to check 
    if the `age` variable is greater than or equal to 18, making decisions based on 
    the result of the comparison.
