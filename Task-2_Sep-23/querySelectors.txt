4.1 What are query selectors, and how are they used in JavaScript?

->  Query selectors in JavaScript are methods that allow you to select and manipulate 
    HTML elements from a web page. They are used to interact with the Document Object Model 
    (DOM) to access, modify, or manipulate elements.

    Common query selectors include:
    `document.querySelector()`: Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
    `document.querySelectorAll()`: Selects all elements that match a CSS selector, 
                                   returning them in a NodeList.

    Example using `querySelector`:

        var heading = document.querySelector("h1"); // Selects the first <h1> element on the page


    Example using `querySelectorAll`:

        var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p"); // Selects all <p> elements on the page


    Query selectors are essential for dynamic web page interactions and manipulation of content 
    through JavaScript.
