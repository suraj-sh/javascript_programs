2.6 Summarize the content covered in the "String Manipulation" section.

->  In the "String Manipulation" section:

    1. String Concatenation: You can combine strings using the `+` operator or the `concat()` method.

    2. String Methods: Methods like `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `length()` help transform 
                       and manipulate strings.

    3. Extracting Substrings: Use `substring()` or square brackets `[]` to extract portions of a string.

    4. Finding Characters: The `indexOf()` method locates the position of a character in a string.

    5. String Interpolation: String interpolation with template literals allows you to embed variables 
                             or expressions within strings for dynamic content.
