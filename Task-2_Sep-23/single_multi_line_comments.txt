3.2 How can you write single-line and multi-line comments in your code?

->  To write comments:

    Single-line comments start with `//` and are used for brief explanations on a single line.
    
        Example: 
            `// This is a single-line comment.`

    Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. They are used for longer explanations 
    spanning multiple lines.

        Example:
            /*
                This is a
                multi-line comment.
            */
