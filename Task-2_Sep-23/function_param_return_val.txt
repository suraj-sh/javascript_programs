4.5 Describe the concept of function parameters and return values.

->  Function parameters are variables that allow you to pass values into a f
    unction when it is called. They act as placeholders for the data the function 
    needs to perform its task.

    Return values are the values that a function can send back to the code that called it. 
    They allow functions to provide results or information to the calling code.

    In summary, function parameters are inputs, and return values are outputs, 
    enabling functions to accept data and produce results.
