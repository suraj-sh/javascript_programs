2.6 Summarize the key points from the "Variables and Data Types" section.

->  In the "Variables and Data Types" section:

    1. Variables are used to store and manage data in JavaScript.
    2. Variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`, 
       with different scoping rules.
    3. JavaScript has primitive data types (e.g., number, string, boolean) 
       and reference data types (e.g., objects, arrays, functions).
    4. Understanding and choosing the appropriate data type is essential for 
       effective data manipulation.
    5. Data type conversion can be achieved using functions like `String()`, 
       `Number()`, and `Boolean()`.
