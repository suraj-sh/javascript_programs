3.6 What are the if/else statements used for, and how do they work?

->  `if/else` statements are used in programming for making decisions based on conditions. 
    They work by evaluating a condition (an expression that is either true or false) and 
    executing different blocks of code depending on whether the condition is true or false.

    `if` statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
    `else` statement: Executes a different block of code if the condition is false.

        Example:

        var age = 18;

        if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
        } 
        else {
            console.log("You are a minor.");
        }

    In this code, if the condition `age >= 18` is true, the first block of code is executed, 
    and "You are an adult." is logged to the console. If the condition is false, 
    the second block of code is executed, and "You are a minor." is logged. `if/else` 
    statements help control the flow of your program based on specific conditions.
