3.1 What is string manipulation, and why is it important?

->  String manipulation refers to the process of modifying or manipulating text (strings) 
    in a programming language. 
    It's important because:

    1. Text Processing: It allows you to work with and transform textual data, enabling 
                        tasks like formatting, searching, and extracting information from strings.

    2. User Interaction: String manipulation is crucial for handling user input, validation, 
                         and generating user-friendly outputs in applications.

    3. Data Transformation: It's essential for converting data between different formats, 
                            such as parsing data from a file or web API.

    4. Dynamic Content: In web development, string manipulation is used to dynamically generate 
                        HTML content, construct URLs, and update elements on a web page.

    In essence, string manipulation is a fundamental skill for many programming tasks, 
    making it a core aspect of software development.
