3.2 Describe how you can concatenate strings in JavaScript.

->  In JavaScript, you can concatenate (combine) strings using the `+` 
    operator or the `concat()` method.

    Using `+` operator:

        var firstName = "Suraj";
        var lastName = "Sharma";
        var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // Concatenation with the + operator


    Using `concat()` method:

        var firstName = "Suraj";
        var lastName = "Sharma";
        var fullName = firstName.concat(" ", lastName); // Concatenation with the concat() method


    Both methods achieve the same result, which is combining two or more strings into one.
