2.5 Discuss the concept of string interpolation.

->  String interpolation is a technique that allows you to embed variables or 
    expressions within a string to create a new string. In JavaScript, 
    you can achieve string interpolation using template literals (enclosed in backticks) 
    and `${}` placeholders.

    Example:

        var name = "Suraj";
        var greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; // String interpolation

    String interpolation makes it easier to create dynamic strings by seamlessly combining 
    variables and text within a single string literal.
